<h1>An Analysis of the Racial Disparities of Public School Expenditure in North Carolina Counties </h1>
<h2>Ian Elliott, Neha Patel, Jay Saini, Hanan Ali</h2>
<h3> Goals </h3>
<p> Our project started with the question: “How do different counties compare to one another with
    regard to funding, diversity, and academic achievement, but also how do those three variables
    compare to each other within individual counties?” Our team’s goals were to analyze public school
    countywide public expenditure to uncover if there were racial disparities in spending.  Our group
    wanted to be able to show the stark differences in expenditure on academics based on counties, but
    we were not entirely sure how to make those metrics meaningful without population and expenditure data
    to understand the reasoning behind certain variables. We started by creating target user personas to create a
    dashboard that will cater well to our audience. The target users were government officials looking to re-allocate
    educational funding, a new family wanting to find high performing schools with a diverse school population in a
    new county, and researchers looking to gain insights on racial disparities.</p>

<h3> Data </h3>
<p> The datasets we used for our project came from multiple sources since we are comparing academic
    achievement, funding and diversity as variables across North Carolina counties. Our first dataset
    came from <a href=(https://dashboard.myfuturenc.org/county-data-and-resources/)>
        MyFutureNC
    </a> which contains in-depth county attainment research with data on the overview
    of each county's demographics and in-depth data on the academic attainments and success of their
    public schools. The next dataset was from The next dataset was from  <a href=(https://linc.osbm.nc.gov/explore/embed/dataset/education/table/?disjunctive.area_name&disjunctive.area_type&disjunctive.year&disjunctive.variable&refine.area_type=County&refine.year=2021&refine.variable=Public%20School%20Expenditures%20(000s))>
                                                  the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management</a>
    which primarily provided us with the county expenditure throughout the years (though we ended up only using
    the most recent; i.e., 2021). The last dataset that was used was the North Carolina County Data for prosperity
    zone, population density, and growth rate. </p>
    <p> In our initial planning, we wanted to find one dataset that contained the variables needed in order
    to answer our main question. However, after trying to find a cohesive and efficient dataset we
    decided to look for 2-3 datasets that contain valuable information that can be joined together.
    </p>

<h3> Data Transformation </h3>
<p> The datasets we used required hours of cleaning and restructuring before we were able to integrate
    them into the project. Initially, we wanted to find one dataset that contained all the variables
    we needed for analysis, but we had to compromise and select three different datasets that had our
    desired variables. The process of joining these datasets was quite rigorous because the data
    required modifications through the process of data cleaning before integrating them into
    scatter plots and other visualizations. We did eventually
    end up joining the MyFutureNC and NC Office of State datasets, adding several columns (as well as some of our
    own metrics, like Diversity Index, which we calculated based on the
    <a href="https://archives.huduser.gov/healthycommunities/sites/default/files/public/Racial%20Diversity%20using%20Shannon-Wiener%20Index.pdf">
        Shannon-Wiener model for diversity index</a>).
    The statistical analysis of our project largely occurred
    when we were implementing our visualizations. Through extensive research and office hour
    visits with Dr. Gotz we were able to firstly integrate our data in our visualizations, then
    integrate our visualizations with each other, so they all update simultaneously. We initially
    planned on having three scatter plots, but due to time constraints and the lack of space on our
    web page we had to compromise with two scatter plots instead. </p>

<h3> Intended Design </h3>

<p> When beginning the project, we started out with a broad idea that we eventually narrowed down.
    When addressing education, there are many attributes that come up, from how well a school is
    performing compared to neighboring schools to how much these schools receive based on their
    performance. Deciding on what features were essential to answering our problem statement in the most
    efficient and effective instance was a challenge. Our users would go beyond the target user personas we
    created, meaning that our dashboard would need to contain inclusive information and visualizations. As a
    group we decided that we need basic population information for each county, to provide a baseline for the
    variables to follow such as expenditure and school performance. </p>
    <p> Our next step was to figure out the best way to present all three variables in a comparable dashboard, where
    users can compare the variables amongst counties. Our first idea was a North Carolina map outlining the counties,
    a barchart with racial demographics, and three scatter plots comparing school expenditure, academic achievement,
    and the diversity index. The map served as a linking tool between the other visualizations on the dashboard. A
    user would select a labeled county and it would automatically change the bar chart and scatter plots to showcase
    the data for the specific county. The barchart contained the race population breakdown for each county. The first
    scatter plot displayed the public school expenditure in comparison to the diversity index. The second scatter plot
    was academic achievement with respect to the diversity index. The last scatterplot was public expenditure and
    academic achievement. All scatter plots would highlight the county that was selected to clearly see the difference
    between the selected county and the remaining counties.
</p>

<h3> Final Prototype </h3>

<img src="Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 7.02.32 PM.png" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:1300px;height:600px;">
<p> Our final prototype largely adhered to the restructured version of our initial design prototype. Users can 
    select any county from either the map or the drop down at the top, and the bar chart and scatter plots will 
    update. The scatter plot will highlight the point that represents the county selected and the barchart will 
    display the racial makeup of the selected county. An example of a user answers an analytical question would be, 
    a governmental official that is interested in finding the public school expenditure of Durham county compared to
    the rest of the North Carolina counties, would select the county on the map, and it will be highlighted on all 
    scatter plots on the dashboard and the expenditure would be displayed. Another example of the final design being 
    used to answer intended analytical questions would be a family moving to North Carolina from a different state 
    would want to see where public expenditure on education is high so their child could get a high quality education 
    with many resources provided, where the diversity index is high so their child can be surrounded by diverse 
    perspectives and backgrounds, and lastly where the number of students is lower so they can get more attention 
    from their teachers. </p>

<h3> Discussion </h3>
<p> Our team mainly designed and developed our original plan, with some minor changes along the way.
    We underestimated how long it would take to code certain visualizations and our data from the beginning.
    There were a lot of data challenges to begin with, which hindered us from moving forward for a while. However,
    our final product came together well even though we compromised some extra features that would’ve assisted users
    with their analysis. </p>
    <p> We divided everything up where each individual worked on something that was of interest or excelled at. Doing a
    group coding project will always be more than expected as multiple people are working on different parts at the
    same time, but we managed to communicate with each other along the way with updates and what needs to be completed.
    We mostly achieved what we thought about this project at the beginning of the semester. The final dashboard is
    fully functioning and has more features that were not originally planned that are more useful.

</p>

<h3> Ethical and Societal Considerations </h3>
<p> Throughout the implementation of our dashboard, we constantly discussed how our decisions about statistical methods,
    such as the creation of our diversity index, are made. Another major discussion was what data points to omit from
    the dashboard in order to fit visualizations onto the screen without scrolling. When we demonstrated our dashboard,
    we noticed some things that should be changed or re-designed to serve the users. For instance, instead of deleting
    data, we kept the data for all 100 counties, which then resulted in a skewed scatter plot that hindered the users’
    ability to select and see the visualization. </p>
    <p> One main ethical question we crossed was “how can we make an unbiased diversity index?” The diversity index used in
    the scatter plot was created by our group based on the data provided. We felt unsure about making a diversity index
    based on one dataset that does not accurately represent the entirety of the county’s school demographics. However,
    for our project, we decided that this was the best approach to calculate the diversity rate for users rather than
    just displaying racial disparity information. </p>
    <p> A societal question we had was “how would, for instance, the U.S. Department of Education benefit from our
    dashboard?” This was a major question since our other user personas are unofficially using our dashboard for
    information. However, the Department of Education would utilize this information to reallocate funding and
    resources. We realized that having an expert opinion would assist in the creation of a dashboard meant for
    official use. At this stage, our dashboard cannot be used for decision-making on a higher governmental level
    based on the data displayed.
